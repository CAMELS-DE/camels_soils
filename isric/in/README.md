## Description

*from: https://www.isric.org/explore/soilgrids/faq-soilgrids#What_is_SoilGrids*

SoilGridsTM (hereafter SoilGrids) is a system for global digital soil mapping that makes use of global soil profile information and covariate data to model the spatial distribution of soil properties across the globe. SoilGrids is a collections of soil property maps for the world produced using machine learning at 250 m resolution.  Predictions are made at six standard depths. SoilGrids uses global models that are calibrated using all available input observations and globally available environmental covariates. This results in globally consistent predictions (no abrupt changes in predicted values at country boundaries, etc).  SoilGrids spatial predictions (layers) are produced using a reproducible soil mapping workflow, and can therefore be regularly updated as new soil data or covariates become available, after quality control and data standardisation/harmonisation.



SoilGrids maps are a global soil data product generated at ISRIC — World Soil Information as a result of international collaboration. For more technical and scientific information about SoilGrids contact the development team.
